            <h6>“Somewhere, something incredible is waiting to be known.” These words by astrophysicist and author Carl Sagan have always urged me to wonder there is so much to learn every single day. Knowledge is so plentiful that one lifetime is not enough to know everything, and thus, I advise my students to learn beyond their syllabus. I believe every student has immense potential to excel. In all our colleges, we provide holistic education and ample avenues to connect with the outer world. Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology is designed to be the second home for the students pursuing their dreams here.

            <h6> At the heart of science is an essential balance between two seemingly contradictory attitudes - openness to new ideas, no matter how bizarre or counterintuitive they may be, and the most ruthless skeptical scrutiny of all ideas, old and new. This is how deep truths are winnowed from deep nonsense.

                Carl Sagan.
            
                I strive for that.
            
                Meghnad Saha Institute of Technology was established in the year 2001 and since then has been rendering yeoman’s service to the nation under the aegis of a Techno India Group, the largest conglomerate and distinguished name in education sector in India with 3 Universities, 21 Engineering colleges, 18 B-Schools, 6 High schools, 40 IT schools, 100 state of the art campuses and many other charitable and philanthropic organizations.
